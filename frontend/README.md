## Project Structure

```
frontend/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.html          # HTML template
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js              # Main application component
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css             # Application styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.js            # React entry point
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.css           # Global styles
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
â””â”€â”€ README.md               # This file
```

## Configuration

By default, the app connects to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/conversation`.

To change the backend URL, edit `WS_URL` in `src/App.js`:

```javascript
const WS_URL = 'ws://your-backend-url:8000/ws/conversation';
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `build/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Can't connect** | Make sure backend is running on port 8000 |
| **Microphone not working** | Check browser permissions for microphone access |
| **No audio playback** | Check browser audio settings and speaker volume |
| **WebSocket errors** | Verify CORS is enabled on backend |
